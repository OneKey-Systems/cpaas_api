# Release 2.0.0
## Previous version
Previous version is 1.1.0 from the original repository, branch v2. 
[Specifically, from this commit](https://github.com/zang-cloud/zang-java/commit/27f58aed0f272d993968308a371f4cb5888a79e1)

## About
This release mainly formalizes the project by fixing bugs that made
unit tests fail and cleaning up the `pom.xml` document. On this release
we have also [uploaded javadocs here.](https://dev.onekey.mx/apidocs/index.html)

## Breaking changes
* `log4j` has been removed as a dependency. Any project that relies on `onekey-zang-java`
for it will need to explicitly add `log4j` to their pom.xml.

## Non-breaking changes
No non-breaking changes have been made to the API.

## Bug fixes
* Fixed failing unit tests. They were calling the wrong-urls on the mock server.
  
* Updated pom.xml with a JDK 11 profile that automatically adds JAXB dependencies 
based on the JDK version. This fixes build failures under JDK 11.
